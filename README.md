# Our project uses the shortest path algorithm to navigate our character through obstacles, sequentially collecting chests of gold, silver, diamonds, and copper. We take the grid size from the user, up to a maximum of 500*500. The left half of our grid has a winter theme, and the right half has a summer theme. The obstacles created are placed on the grid in different shapes according to this theme.
